    "description": "This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred . The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators, LOCAL SERVICE . Note:  Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the Domain Controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to  access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the Domain Controllers. Page 83 Rationale: Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to  a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator -defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most Domain Controllers, Member Servers, and end -user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with Domain Controllers in the following ways: \u2022 All client desktop computers and Member Servers use the authenticating Domain Controller as their inbound time partner. \u2022 All Domain Controllers in a domain nominate the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. \u2022 All PDC Emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. \u2022 The PDC Emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate.",

The\nGuest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: Disabled .\nNote:  This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers\norganizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account\ndatabase. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account\nlockout a nd password policy settings.\nRationale:\nThe default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest\nwith no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are\naccessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any\nnetwork shares  with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests\ngroup, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to\nthe exposure or corruption of data.\nImpact:\nAll network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources. If\nyou disable the Guest account and the Network Access: Sharing and Security Model\noption is set to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft\nNetwork Server (SMB Service), will fail.

There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character strin g of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s) . Note:  In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starti ng with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length.

If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account locko uts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number o f character combinations, much harder to discover. Note:  Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters.

Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can\nuse tools to discover the accounts and  passwords.\nPage 47 Impact:\nRequirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an\norganization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose\nit. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account\nlocko uts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with\nforgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your\nusers about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger\nnumber o f character combinations, much harder to discover.\nNote:  Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not\nsupport passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older\noperating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use\naccounts that requi re long passwords.\nAudit:\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as\nprescribed.\nRemediation:\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or\nmore character(s) :\nComputer Configuration \\Policies \\Windows Settings \\Security Settings \\Account\nPolicies \\Password Policy \\Minimum password length\nDefault Value:",

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: \u2022 Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters \u2022 Be at least six characters in length \u2022 Contain characters from three of the following categories: o English uppercase characters (A through Z) o English lowercase characters (a through z) o Base 10 digits (0 through 9) o Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) o A catch -all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven -character, all lower -case alphabetic password would have 26 to the power of 7 (approximately 8 x 10 to the power of 9 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password -cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven -character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 52 to the power of 7 combinations. A seven -character case -sensiti ve alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight -character password has 26 to the power of 8 (or 2 x 10 to the power of 11) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as \"!\" or \"@\". Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled .

This setting may generate\nadditional help desk calls.\nIf you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by\ndeliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also\nconfigure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value.\nIf you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an\nattacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go\nundetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place.\nAudit:\nNavigate to the UI Path articulated in the Remediation section and confirm it is set as\nprescribed.\nPage 60 Remediation:\nTo establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 5 or\nfewer invalid login attempt(s), but not 0 :\nComputer Configuration \\Policies \\Windows Settings \\Security Settings \\Account\nPolicies \\Account Lockout Policy \\Account lockout threshold\nDefault Value:",

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man -in-the-middle attacks.

IPv6 allows for\nmany more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and\noperating systems may not support IPv6 natively.\nThe recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)\nRationale:\nSince the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize\nIPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6\ncomponents removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic\non. As  a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not\nneeded.\nConfiguring this recommendation to the CIS suggested state mitigates CVE-2024 -",

This appears to have been a mistake in the ADMX/ADML Templates for that\nrelease.\nStarting with the Microsoft Windows 11 Release 24H2 Administrative Templates, the\nsetting Configures LSASS to run as a protected process  has a new registry location of\nHKLM \\Software \\Policies \\Microsoft \\Windows \\System . In addition, the setting LSA\nProtection  will be displayed by GPME when this setting ( Configures LSASS to run as a\nprotected process ) is configured.\nIf Configures LSASS to run as a protected process  was configured using an older\nversion of the ADML/ADML templates, the new registry location will not auto -apply to\nthe system, and assessment scans using the latest benchmark might fail. To fix this\nissue, the ADMX/ADML templates must be updated to the la test version, the setting\nremoved from the GPO, and then added back in.\nIf the Microsoft Windows 10 Benchmark is applied, LSA Protection  is configured via a\nseparate recommendation for older versions of the Windows 10 Operating System\nusing the SecGuide.admx/adml  templates. That configuration is checked for separately\nfrom this recommendation.\nDefault Value:\nNot configured.

Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive builds from our active development branch that is earliest in a development cycle. These builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release. Beta Channel:  Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10 features. Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers ensure key issues are fixed before a major release. Release Preview Channel (default):  Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend companies preview and valida te upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment within their organization.

For additional information on Preview Builds, see: Managing preview builds across your organization - Windows Insider Program | Microsoft Learn . This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received. Defer Updates  This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre -release channels and up to 365 days for the Semi -Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi -Annual Channel, a version  for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release Information page for OS version information. Pause Updates  To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be offered). Note:  If the \"Allow Diagnostic Data\" (formerly \"Allow Telemetry\") policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect.

The\nsettings included in this section are intended to harden the system and are applied on a\nper-user basis, reflected to each domain -joined interactive user\u2019s\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)  registry hive. Each interactively logged -on user has\nits own HKCU  hive, which is a context -sensitive, per -user, symbolic link to a subkey\nunder HKEY_USERS (HKU) , wher e the user\u2019s Security Identifier (SID) is the subkey\nname (Ex: HKU\\S-1-5-21-123123123 -123123123 -1231231231 -12312 ). User SIDs for\nthis scenario always begin with S-1-5-21-* for active directory domain -joined\naccounts.\nThe group policy engine applies user configuration settings to the HKU \\SID subkeys for\ninteractive logons, including local console logons, remote desktop logons, and RunAs\nlogons. User configuration settings are not applied to the built -in NT AUTHORITY\nservice accounts (System, Network Service, and Local Service), nor to any other\nservice logons. User configuration settings configured through active directory domain\ngroup policy objects (GPO) are not applied to local user accounts.\nWhen validating user configuration settings for compliance, each recommendation\nshould be checked against all currently -logged -on interactive users\u2019 hives:\n\u2022 Audit all HKEY_USERS  subkeys with key names beginning with S-1-5-21-*\nand do not end with _Classes .\n\u2022 Do not audit subkeys named .DEFAULT , S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, or S-1-5-20.\n\u2022 Do not audit any NT SERVICE  SIDs (S-1-5-80-).\n\u2022 Do not load the hives of users that are not currently logged on ( NTUSER.DAT\nfiles) as part of compliance verification.\nA user configuration setting is considered in compliance if the correct configuration is\nfound in all applicable user hives as described above. If there are multiple users logged\non and the setting is correctly configured in some but not all the applicable  user hives,\nthe recommendation is not in full compliance.\nIf a system has no actively logged -on users, the recommendations in this section are\nnot considered out of compliance. User accounts ( S-1-5-21-*) that only log on as a\nservice (service accounts), will not receive user configuration settings to its HKU\nregistry hive since the group policy engine will not write to this type of account.\nCompliance findings for these accounts should be ignored.\nPage 1246  Why CIS recommends not auditing all the HKU  subkeys:\n\u2022 Group policy applies user configuration settings only to HKU  subkey hives\nassociated with interactive logons. It never applies the settings to the NT\nAUTHORITY  service account subkeys ( S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, S-1-5-20, or\n.DEFAULT ) or the NT SERVICE  subkeys ( S-1-5-80-*).\no The HKU\\S-1-5-18 is a symbolic link to HKU \\.DEFAULT , so the key\ncontent is identical.\n\u2022 The HKU \\SID_Classes  subkey represents the subkey of the corresponding\nHKU \\SID\\SOFTWARE \\Classes , to which they are symbolically linked.\nWhy CIS recommends not loading the NTUSER.DAT  file(s) to audit the hives of users\nthat are not currently logged on:\n\u2022 Unnecessary false positives of old user profiles that were last loaded before the\nnew or updated GPO containing the user configuration settings were applied.\no These accounts would be found out of compliance, with no supportable\nway to bring them into compliance other than the user logging on or\ndeleting the old profiles.\no These account settings being out of compliance should not cause issues if\nthe user never logs on; and if they do, a group policy update should bring\nthem into compliance.\n\u2022 Risk of system issues if the user logs on while the scanning tool has the hive\nloaded, and then also when the scanning tool unloads the hive.\n\u2022 Significant performance hit.\nUser configuration settings configured through active directory domain GPOs are not\napplied to local user accounts. Since these accounts begin with the SID S-1-5-21-*, a\nfailure may occur with CIS -CAT and other third -party assessment tools. To mitigate this,\nuser recommendations (Section 19 of this benchmark) should be applied to local\naccounts separately. If this is not a concern for the organization, local accounts s hould\nbe ignored. The above is also true when an account with a S-1-5-21-* SID logs on as\na service.\nPage 1247  19.1 Control Panel\nThis section is intentionally blank and exists to ensure the structure of Windows\nbenchmarks is consistent.\nThis Group Policy section is provided by the Group Policy template\nWindows.admx/adml  that is included with all versions of the Microsoft Windows\nAdministrative Templates.",
